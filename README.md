# Distracted Driver Detection

<ul>
<li>We aim to better road safety by preventing distracted driving.</li>

<li>We propose a standalone hardware IOT unit, which could be attached to the passenger side of the car.</li>

</li>The IOT unit will run a deep learning model which will continuously classify the driver images (captured via an inbuilt camera) into 10 classes.</li>
